# Trash and Dumpsites

### Notes

-   The R functions assess_trash() and assess_dumpsites() require dataframe inputs of processed RSA reach data and RSA point data (dumpsites only)

-   The watershed layer included in RSA database was not used due to issue found. For example, layer "Watersheds_Notes_RSA2021" has missing area in Rock Creek. Instead used: [DC Subwatersheds  Open Data Layer](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/dc-subwatersheds/explore?location=38.890772%2C-77.021832%2C12.98&showTable=true).

<br>

### Steps for processing RSA stream reach and point data

1.  In StreamPoints feature layer, copy GlobalID to a new field

    -   Set data type of the new to GUID

    -   New field name suggestion: GlobalID_copy

    -   This step is needed so that the GlobalID information will be included in the intersected table

2.  Intersect [DC Subwatersheds  Open Data Layer](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/dc-subwatersheds/explore?location=38.890772%2C-77.021832%2C12.98&showTable=true) with StreamPoints layer

3.  Run the 'Add Attribute Index' tool:

    -   Field to Index: GlobalID_copy

    -   Index Name: GlobalID_index

4.  Join StreamPoints attributes table to StreamPoints feature layer. See settings in screenshot below:

    ![](figures/rsa_join.png){width="326"}

5.  Export joined StreamPoints table to Excel

    -   Save file to R package data folder
    -   Update file name input variable in workflow.R file

6.  In the input variables section of workflow.R, update the field name prefix variables (if needed)

7.  Repeat steps 1, 3,4, 5 and 6 using StreamReaches feature layer and attribute table

    -   Skip Step 2 since subshed information is already included as a field in the StreamReaches feature layer

# Effective Impervious Area (EIA)

### Notes

-   Subshed area calculations done [external]{.underline} to R package. Lookup tables must be updated manually. The final EIA percentage and score calculations are done in R.

-   BMP Data timeframe should always begin from January 1, 2000.

-   There are two lookup tables that need to be manually updated with each annual SCI run:

    -   eia_subsheds

    -   eia_rock_creek

-   In addition to the sci_subshed field, the main columns from the lookup tables that get used by the R functions have the prefix "analysis\_"

    -   Analysis_subshed_m2

    -   Analysis_impervious_m2

    -   Analysis_impervious_treated_m2

-   The columns with particular years are for reference so that the GIS analysis does not have to be repeated if numbers are needed later on

-   Special subshed notes:

    -   Piney Branch is the only sci_subshed that is in both the MS4 and CSS. The eia_subsheds lookup table includes both the MS4 and CSS subsheds as two separate segments.

    -   Reservation 630 used as sci_subshed, but Melvin Hazen Valley Branch is used to lookup the same subwatershed from other data sources

### Steps for impervious area calculation

*Only perform the following steps if there is a new impervious surface available on Open Data DC*

1.  Start with the latest impervious surface layer from Open Data DC (e.g., [2023 Impervious Surface](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/b381c84937cd4d3a8beae65c265b772d_73/explore))

2.  Intersect impervious surface with layer with the Open Data [DC Subwatersheds](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::dc-subwatersheds/explore) layer

3.  Dissolve intersected layer to summarize and reduce the number of features (See screenshot below for Dissolve settings)

    ![](figures/impervious_dissolve.png)

4.  Export the Dissolve table to excel.

5.  Update the lookup tables in the R package spreadsheet. In the data/lookup_tables.xlsx, modify the eia_subsheds and eia_rock_creek spreadsheet tabs:

    -   Add a new column called "20XX_impervious_m2" and bring in data from the Dissolve table

    -   Update the "analysis_impervious_m2" column by referencing the new column created

    -   Save the spreadsheet

6.  In the workflow.R script, uncomment out the code for eia_subsheds and eia_rock_creek. Run code to update the two .rda files. Re-comment code.

### Steps for impervious treated calculation

1.  Export BMP data from the SGS using the IPMT query - Start date: January 1, 2000 - End date: December 31, 20XX (use last year in target 5-year period)

2.  In Excel, remove BMP records that do not meet the Chesapeake Bay inspection criteria. For BMPs installed over 10 years ago, BMPs must have a passing inspection within the last 10 years.

    -   Use the following three fields to identify and remove the BMP records that are older than 10 years and do not have a passing inspection: (1) Installation Date; (2) Most recent Inspection (3) Passed or failed most recent maintenance inspection?

    -   As an example, for the SCI timeframe of 2020-2024, all BMPs installed prior to January 1, 2015 must have a passing inspection.

3.  In ArcGIS Pro, bring in table from SGS export and display as XY data

4.  Intersect the BMP point data with the Open Data [DC Subwatersheds](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::dc-subwatersheds/explore) layer

5.  Dissolve using the settings in the below screenshot

    ![](figures/bmps_dissolve.png)

6.  Export Dissolve table to Excel

7.  Convert impervious area sum from ft^2^ to m^2^

8.  Update the lookup tables in the R package spreadsheet. In the data/lookup_tables.xlsx, modify the eia_subsheds and eia_rock_creek spreadsheet tabs:

    -   Add a new column called "20XX_impervious_treated_m2" and bring in data from the Dissolve table

    -   Update the "analysis_impervious_treated_m2" column by referencing the new column created

    -   Save the spreadsheet

9.  In the workflow.R script, uncomment out the code for eia_subsheds and eia_rock_creek. Run code to update the two .rda files. Re-comment code.
